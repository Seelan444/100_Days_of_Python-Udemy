# Python-100-Days-of-Code

Hello,

This repository contains my journey of completing **100 Days of Python Code** inspired by Dr. Angela Yu's [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

## Beginner
Day 01: Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data — Band Name Generator  
Day 02: Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings — Tip Calculator  
Day 03: Control Flow and Logical Operators — Treasure Island  
Day 04: Randomisation and Python Lists — Rock Paper Scissors  
Day 05: Python Loops — Password Generator  
Day 06: Python Functions & Karel — Reeborg's World  
Day 07: Hangman — Hangman  
Day 08: Function Parameters & Caesar Cipher — Caesar Cipher  
Day 09: Dictionaries, Nesting and the Secret Auction — Silent Bidding  
Day 10: Function with Outputs — Calculator  
Day 11: Blackjack Capstone Project — BlackJack  
Day 12: Scope and Namespacing in Python — Guess The Number  
Day 13: Debugging: How to Find and Fix Errors in your Code — N/A  
Day 14: Higher Lower Game Project — Higher Lower  

## Notes
* Every day's main.py file includes not only the main project but also the day's practice exercises, experiments, and related work.
* Each project typically has two versions: my version/tried version (how I initially implemented it) and correct or easier version (refined or course-recommended approach).
* This README will grow as I progress through the 100 days.
